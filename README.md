# Article preview component

## Challenge by Frontend Mentor



The Article Preview Component project is my version of the [Frontend Mentors Challenge ](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/article-preview-component-dYBN_pYFT) of the same name. 

The project consists of a responsive preview card, with different layouts for mobile and desktop with an activable social sharing section for both, realized using HTML, CSS and javascript.
